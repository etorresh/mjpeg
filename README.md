"MJPEG is based on the mature compression standard i.e. JPEG that has well-defined libraries. It could not be standardized similar to standards such as MPEG-2 and there is no documentation available that can be referred to as complete specifications for the “Motion JPEG”. In the absence of such a standard, outputs from different manufacturers can raise compatibility issues. However, companies like Microsoft and Apple have documented how the M-JPEG files are stored in their native formats such as AVI and QT. The rfc2435 describes the RTP Payload Format for JPEG-compressed Video and can be consulted as reference material."
